# LJ Code 201 - Day 2
Today I learned for loops which I can tell are very important when dealing with user input. The user has so many options to answer your question, if you don't include all the possible answers from the user then your code is trash. Something useful use counter++ to log all the answers in your code. Also when using else if's you can have unlimited else if's. Overall today was great and can't wait for what tomorrow has in store!
