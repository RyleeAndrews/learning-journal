#Code 201 Day 7 learning journal
Today I learned a much simpler way of objects and methods. Today we learned how to use constructors which allows you to globally store attributes to objects then being able to call them from outside a function. Learning how to do this cut 100 lines of code off my code the day before. Can't wait to learn more shortcuts to make my code shorter and a lot more pleasing to the eye.
