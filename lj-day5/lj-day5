Today was very difficult for me trying to do the third function. The first two functions were very easy since they only turn one var and a return. And the last two were easy once I knew how to structure a function into another function. But the third function was difficult because I did not know the structure so I was hitting many dead ends. I found out it is very useful to ask other classmates how to solve a problem because chances are someone has it and is happy to help out.
