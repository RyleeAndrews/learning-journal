# Code 201 Learning Journal Day 16
Today was our first day of our group project and it went well for the most part. In the beginning of the day we got together in our group and we drew out on the desks what we wanted our page to look like and how we wanted it to function all the way down to how many div's each part of the website should have. Then we got to work. I was in charge of making the table for the admin page and along the way I faced just small errors that would throw me off. After just countless hours of little errors I was finally able to get my code running and the table looks great.
