# Code 201 Learning Journal
Today we worked on handling errors when you go to do a merge request and you have some errors. If there is one thing I can say with certainty and it's that I understand git and the errors it throws me probably the most out of all the subjects in 201. I think it's really nice that git throws you errors in merging because then you can catch any errors early rather than go all the way through the project before you realize that each partner is working on something different on the project. That would be a nightmare.
