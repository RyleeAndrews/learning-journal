# Code 201 Learning Journal day 11
Today we were given the task of creating three random photos for a focus group proxy test and I have to be honest it kicked my ass. I spent 10 hours yesterday on the assignment and though I am close, I am at a dead end. The hardest part for me is making sure no duplicates are shown when tested. But I digress and excited to cover this in class tomorrow!
