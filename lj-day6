#Code 201 learning journal day 6
Today I learned a lot about objects. I can already see how useful objects will be coming up and I can not wait to learn ways to make my javascript code a lot cleaner and easier to code. Today was very hard for me I really struggled with the structure of some of the functions but eventually I persevered and now I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on everything! Can't wait for tomorrow.
