# Code 201 Learning Journal Day 19
Today was our last day to work on our projects and it went great. It never felt like we were rushed to get it done because we almost had full functionality at the start of the day. Today was mostly error handling and styling for the pages. I did work on adding the table to the employee page so that when the admin adds someone to the schedule they can see that on their employee page table. Excited for presenting tomorrow.
