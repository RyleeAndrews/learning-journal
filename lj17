# Code 201 Learning Journal Day 17
Today was day two for our project and week and it went very well today. We added all the features we wanted and they work so now on to adding a few more things then it is time for css and to make the page pretty. I learned a lot about error handling today so I feel like my coding skills are getting better and better!
