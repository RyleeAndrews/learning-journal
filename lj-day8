# Code 201 Learning Journal Day 8
Today we learned how to make forms for events such as submit. At first I didn't comprehend anything and was just stuck but after the TA's showed me part of what I wanted everything fell into place. What I'm getting from this is things are a lot easier if I just take a deep breath and try to comprehend what's in front of me. I feel like this has been the easiest structure so far though so I am feeling pretty confident after today. Excited for tomorrow.
